# 🌍 Global Income Inequality: Visualizing Lorenz Curves & Gini Coefficients

This project explores the patterns of income inequality around the world using data from the **World Bank's Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP)**. Through the lens of **Gini Coefficients** and **Lorenz Curves**, we quantify inequality trends, simulate redistribution scenarios such as **targeted subsidies** and **progressive taxation**, and assess their impact on reducing inequality.

## 📦 Dataset
- **Source**: [World Bank - PIP Percentile Distributions](https://pip.worldbank.org)
- **Key variables**: `country_code`, `year`, `percentile`, `avg_welfare`, `pop_share`, `welfare_share`
- **Coverage**: 2,456 country-year distributions using microdata, grouped, or synthetic data

## 📊 Visualizations & Key Insights

### 1. **Gini Trends Across Selected Countries**
This line chart illustrates Gini coefficient trajectories over time for countries with diverse economic contexts:
- **Brazil (BRA)** and **South Africa (ZAF)** have persistently high inequality (>0.55)
- **United States (USA)** shows stable inequality in the range of 0.38–0.45
- **China (CHN)** experienced a sharp rise in inequality during economic liberalization, followed by a recent decline
- **Indonesia (IDN)** maintains moderate inequality but is still vulnerable

### 2. **Global Inequality Map**
A choropleth map of Gini coefficients using the most recent available year for each country. Darker red represents higher inequality.

### 3. **Lorenz Curve: Indonesia 2019**
This curve visualizes income distribution in Indonesia before any intervention.
- Gini: **0.3728**
- The bottom 20% of the population controls less than 5% of total income, while the top 10% controls a disproportionately large share.

### 4. **Redistribution Simulation: Subsidy vs Progressive Taxation**
#### 💰 Scenario 1: Direct Subsidy to Bottom 50%
- Adds $0.5 per capita to the poorest 50%
- Gini drops to **0.3020** (↓ 18.97%)

#### 💼 Scenario 2: Progressive Tax (10% tax on top 10%, redistributed to bottom 40%)
- Gini drops further to **0.2954** (↓ 20.74%)

### 5. **Lorenz Curve Comparison: Before vs After Redistribution**
The green line (after redistribution) shifts closer to the line of equality, reflecting a more equitable income distribution.

## 📈 Final Results Summary

| Scenario                        | Gini Coefficient | Change from Original |
|----------------------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| 🎯 Before Redistribution         | 0.3728           | —                      |
| 💰 Subsidy to Bottom 50%         | 0.3020           | ↓ 18.97%               |
| 💼 Tax Top 10% → Bottom 40%      | 0.2954           | ↓ 20.74%               |

## 🧭 Policy Implications
- Inequality remains a global issue, especially in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa.
- Direct subsidies help, but **progressive taxation** proves to be slightly more efficient in reducing inequality.
- **Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients** offer intuitive tools to evaluate redistribution policies.
- Countries with similar Gini values may differ greatly in who holds the wealth and how policies affect them.

---

## 🧩 Next Steps & Project Expansion
- Simulate additional redistribution scenarios (e.g., multiple tax brackets)
- Build an interactive dashboard using **Streamlit**
- Export results as **automated PDF/HTML reports**
- Integrate with macroeconomic indicators (HDI, GDP per capita, poverty rates)
