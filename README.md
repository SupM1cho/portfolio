# 🧠 Data Science Portfolio by Rizky

Welcome to my personal **Data Science Portfolio**. This repository showcases a collection of projects I’ve worked on, ranging from real-world data analysis and machine learning to interactive visualizations and applied research. Each project reflects a unique problem-solving approach, technical exploration, and storytelling through data.

## 🚀 What You'll Find Here

This portfolio includes a diverse range of projects, including but not limited to:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth investigations of real-world datasets to uncover trends, anomalies, and insights.
- **Predictive Modeling & Machine Learning:** Supervised and unsupervised learning models built using scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and more.
- **Deep Learning for Medical Imaging:** Multi-label classification of chest X-ray images using transfer learning with DenseNet-169.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Sentiment analysis on product reviews and real-time lyric extraction using APIs.
- **Spatio-Temporal Data Projects:** Earthquake data comparison and ShakeMap intensity prediction using combined datasets from BMKG and USGS.
- **Interactive Dashboards & Visualizations:** Visual storytelling using tools like Streamlit, Plotly, and Folium.
- **Statistical Analysis & Inequality Metrics:** Visualization of global inequality through Lorenz Curves and Gini Coefficients based on World Bank data.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Languages:** Python, R, SQL  
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost, NLTK, OpenCV
